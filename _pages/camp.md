# CoderDojoChi Coding Camp
{: style="text-align: center" }

CoderDojoChi is excited to announce our 2017 coding summer camp! Campers learn the fundamentals of web technologies to create, code, and produce their own project-based website. Camp ends with a special showcase presentation for family and friends.

**Students work side-by-side with professionals** in the field of computer science during this **intensive, five day workshop**. They will learn not only the fundamentals of web technologies but will also experience how a real-world project moves through its lifecycle.

Every session provides students with an opportunity to take a hands-on approach to their projects. Working closely with mentors allows plenty of room for discussion and reflection on one another's work, ultimately presenting to peers, guests, family, and friends.

## Who

**Only 20 Chicago youth, ages 9 to 15**, will be in each co-hort to allow a high level of individual mentor-to-student attention.
